		<description><![CDATA[Well come to the Jerusalem, 
			The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem was a crusader state established in the Southern Levant in 1099 after the First Crusade. 
			The kingdom lasted nearly two hundred years, from 1099 until 1291 when the last remaining possession, 
			Acre, was destroyed by the Mamluks, but its history is divided into two distinct periods. 
			The first kingdom lasted from 1099 to 1187, when it was almost entirely overrun by Saladin. After the subsequent Third Crusade, the kingdom was re-established in Acre in 1192, 
			and lasted until that city's destruction in 1291. This second kingdom is sometimes called the Kingdom of Acre.
